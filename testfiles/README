This directory contains a collection of tests for automated regression testing
using l3build and some manual tests.

    -`babel` contains babel's l3build tests related with catalan.
    -`latex` contains our own l3build tests for use with pdflatex, luatex and
    xetex.
    -`plain` contains our own l3build tests for use with plain TeX.
    -`manual` contains manual tests, as of now they can only be compiled and
    inspected visually.

To run the automated tests, execute `l3build check` from the main directory.
